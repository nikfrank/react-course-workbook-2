# react course workbook 2

Here we'll work with user input for the first time

React treats inputs a bit differently than maybe we're used to:

JQuery: (user input -> value in DOM; submit -> read DOM input value -> trigger API call)

React: (user input -> value saved in state; submit -> read from state, trigger API call)

We have plenty of examples to work through here.

Also check out my funky SVG animation!



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
